                  For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the
                  hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience
                  most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we
                  share in our world are far more valuable than those which
                  divide us. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty
                  and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
                  and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like
                  a giant. I felt very, very small.<br /><br />To be the first
                  to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an
                  unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything
                  more? There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the
                  stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to
                  occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one
                  makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning. We are
                  all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth,
                  chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.
